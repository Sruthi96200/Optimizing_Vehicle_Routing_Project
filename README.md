üìå Project Title
Optimizing Vehicle Routing with Time Windows Using Julia

üìñ Overview
This project addresses the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) ‚Äî a classic logistics optimization challenge. A homogeneous fleet of vehicles must deliver to a set of customers, adhering to strict delivery time windows and vehicle capacity constraints. Each route starts and ends at a central depot. The primary objective is to minimize the total number of vehicles utilized, ensuring that:

Each customer is visited exactly once

Time window and capacity constraints are fully respected

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
A detailed MILP formulation is developed using the JuMP package in Julia. The model includes:

Binary decision variables to represent whether a vehicle travels from one node to another

Continuous variables to track service start times

Constraints for time windows, route flow, and capacity limitations

This model provides an exact solution to the VRPTW using a mathematical programming approach.

2. Column Generation Technique
To scale the problem efficiently, the project also implements a Column Generation approach:

Begins with a set of trivial routes (each serving a single customer)

Iteratively solves a restricted master problem

Uses a pricing subproblem to generate cost-reducing new routes

This decomposition method is especially effective for large-scale instances with many customers.

üìä Dataset & Assumptions
Customer coordinates and demand values are provided

Depot is defined as the final entry in the dataset

Travel times are computed using Euclidean distances

All inputs are assumed to be non-negative integers

üí° Key Highlights
Implemented in Julia using the JuMP optimization framework

Demonstrates both exact and scalable heuristic approaches

Includes code, visualizations, and performance comparisons

Applicable to real-world transportation, distribution, and supply chain scenarios

üìå Project Title
Optimizing Vehicle Routing with Time Windows Using Julia

üìñ Overview
This project focuses on solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)‚Äîa fundamental challenge in logistics and operations research. A homogeneous fleet of vehicles is tasked with delivering goods to a set of customers, each with specified time windows and demand constraints. Every vehicle must start and end at a central depot, and the goal is to minimize the total number of vehicles used, while ensuring:

Each customer is visited exactly once

All time window and vehicle capacity constraints are satisfied

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
üîπ 1. Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
A comprehensive MILP model is formulated and implemented using the Julia JuMP optimization package. The model includes:

Binary variables representing whether a vehicle travels from node i to node j

Continuous variables for the service start times at customer locations

Constraints for route continuity, time windows, and vehicle capacity

This approach provides an exact solution for small- to medium-sized instances of the VRPTW.

üîπ 2. Column Generation Technique
To handle larger problem sizes more efficiently, a Column Generation approach is employed:

Begins with a set of trivial routes, each serving a single customer

Solves a Restricted Master Problem (RMP) using these initial routes

Iteratively introduces new routes via a Pricing Subproblem that identifies cost-reducing columns

This method is scalable and effective for large-scale instances of the VRPTW.

üìä Dataset & Assumptions
Customer data includes coordinates and demand values

The depot is the final entry in the dataset

Euclidean distance is used to calculate travel times

All parameters (service times, demands, time windows) are non-negative integers

üí° Key Highlights
Implemented entirely in Julia using the JuMP modeling language

Demonstrates both exact and decomposition-based solution methods

Includes visualizations, performance metrics, and algorithmic comparisons

Applicable to real-world logistics, transportation planning, and supply chain optimization

üß† Skills Demonstrated
Combinatorial optimization and mathematical modeling

Mixed-integer programming (MIP) with real-world constraints

Column generation and decomposition techniques
